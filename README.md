# The Peanut Gallery
Welcome to the Peanut Gallery! This is a movie review site for the people who have no real business reviewing movies, like ourselves.

**Link to project:** https://peanut-gallery.onrender.com


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We used Express to handle the server, as well as EJS for the templating language.  We included the node-fetch library so we could process our external API requests in the backend, to make sure the API keys stayed hidden. We use dotenv to protect our secret files, passport.js with the local strategy to implement authentication to our webapp, as well as bcrypt to encrypt the passwords. The database being used is MongoDB using Mongoose and it's ability to use Schemas.  

## Optimizations

We will be adding a section that has all reviews available, as well as a search function to be able to look to see if a certain movie has already been reviewed, and by who. 

## Lessons Learned:

We learned how to add authentication to our application, as well as how to better work on a team.  Using github as our code hosting platform, we learned how to cleanly merge our code into the main repository so we are all working off the same updated code.
